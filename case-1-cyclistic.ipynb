For this case I used R Studio for data preparation, analysis, and visualization.\n\n **Scenario:** I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. \n\n* Cyclistic has 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. \n\n* The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. \n\n* Until now, the companys marketing strategy relied on appealing to broad consumer segments through flexible pricing plans. \n\n* This consits of single-passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. \n\n* Customers purchasing single-day or full-day passes are casual riders.\n\n* Customers purchasing annual memberships are Cyclistic members. \n\n**Task:** In order to increase profts, the director of marketing wants design a marketing strategy at converting casual riders to annual members. Therefore, I am tasked with analyzing historical bike trip data to better understand how annual members and causal member use bikes differently. \n\n**The data:** I will use Cyclistic's historical 12-month [dataset](http://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) for the year 2021 (Jan 2021 to Dec 2021). The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company, but are appropriate for answering the business questions for this case. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](http://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) and operates the City of Chicagoâ€™s Divvy bicycle sharing service.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nlibrary(tidyverse)  #helps wrangle data\nlibrary(lubridate)  #helps wrangle date attributes\nlibrary(ggplot2)  #helps visualize data\ngetwd() #displays your working directory","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-11T23:39:14.506714Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-11T23:39:14.507931Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-11T23:39:14.526489Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Upload Divvy datasets (csv files) here\nlibrary(readr)\nJan <- read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/January.csv\")\nFeb <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/February.csv\")\nMar <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/March.csv\")\nApr <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/April.csv\")\nMay <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/May.csv\")\nJune <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/June.csv\")\nJuly <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/July.csv\")\nAug <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/August.csv\")\nSep <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/September.csv\")\nOct <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/October.csv\")\nNov <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/November.csv\")\nDec <-read_csv(\"../input/cyclisticdivvy/December.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-11T23:40:22.240352Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-11T23:40:22.241595Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-11T23:40:24.596364Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Compare column names each of the files\n# While the names don't have to be in the same order, they DO need to match perfectly before we can use a command to join them into one file\ncolnames(Jan)\ncolnames(Feb)\ncolnames(Mar)\ncolnames(Apr)\ncolnames(May)\ncolnames(June)\ncolnames(July)\ncolnames(Aug)\ncolnames(Sep)\ncolnames(Oct)\ncolnames(Nov)\ncolnames(Dec)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-11T23:40:33.511787Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-11T23:40:33.513306Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-11T23:40:33.947830Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruence\nstr(Jan)\nstr(Feb)\nstr(Mar)\nstr(Apr)\nstr(May)\nstr(June)\nstr(July)\nstr(Aug)\nstr(Sep)\nstr(Oct)\nstr(Nov)\nstr(Dec)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-11T23:40:37.601577Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-11T23:40:37.603477Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-11T23:40:37.950260Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# stack individual month's data frames into one big data frame\n# since all the datasets have the same column names and data frame, we can stack into one data frame\nall_trips <- bind_rows(Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,June,July,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-11T23:40:45.203834Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-11T23:40:45.205298Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-11T23:41:01.597060Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remove latitude & longitude\nall_trips <- all_trips %>%  \n  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-11T23:41:08.521493Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-11T23:41:08.522965Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-11T23:41:08.542279Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Inspect the new table that has been created:\n\ncolnames(all_trips)  #List of column names","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-11T23:41:11.827508Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-11T23:41:11.829238Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-11T23:41:11.849650Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame? 5595063 rows      \ndim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame? 5595063 rows, 9 columns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-11T23:41:14.757233Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-11T23:41:14.759124Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-11T23:41:14.785518Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.

Casual members have a higher bike usage rate with their average duration roughly double the usage rate of annual members. \n\n  * Cyclistic can create an advertisement with brief statistical descriptions that help incentivize casual members to switch to being an annual member by highlighting how much money they can save. \n\n\n2. Casual members take more bike rides on the weekend and less rides during the week, when compared to annual members.\n\n  * Cyclistic can create a special annual membership program that is limited to weekends only. \n\n  * Cyclistic can also incorporate partnerships with surrounding business on the weekends, incentivizing casual members to purchase goods by offering a Cyclistic discount. \n\n","metadata":{}}]}
